INTRODUCTION                                                             *grep*

This plugin is a wrapper around Grin (the python version of Ack) and can be used
as a replacement for grep.  This plugin will allow you to run grin from vim, and
shows the results in a split window.

:Grin[!] [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                              *:Grin*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given the first
    error is jumped to.

:GrinAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                           *:GrinAdd*

    Just like |:Grin|, but instead of making a new list, the matches are
    appended to the current |quickfix| list.

:GrinFromSearch [{directory}]                                 *:GrinFromSearch*

    Just like |:Grin| but the pattern is from previous search.

:LGrin [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                               *:LGrin*

    Just like |:Grin| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed in
    the current |location-list|.

:LGrinAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                         *:LGrinAdd*

    Just like |:GrinAdd| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are added
    to the current |location-list|

:GrinFile [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                         *:GrinFile*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for filenames matching the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the
    |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

:GrinHelp[!] [options] {pattern}                                    *:GrinHelp*

    Search vim documentation files for the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the 
    |:Grin| command, but searches only vim documentation .txt files

:LGrinHelp [options] {pattern}                                     *:LGrinHelp*

    Just like |:GrinHelp| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed
    in the current |location-list|.

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence.  <Enter> on
a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.

information.

MAPPINGS                                                        *Grin-mappings*

The following keyboard shortcuts are available in the quickfix window:

o                   open file (same as enter).

go                  preview file (open but maintain focus on Grin.vim results).

t                   open in a new tab.

T                   open in new tab silently.

h                   open in horizontal split.

H                  open in horizontal split silently.

v                   open in vertical split.

gv                  open in vertical split silently.

q                   close the quickfix window.
